 The project above is an end to end machine learning model to predict house prices ,the data is gotten from kaggle datasets. 
 The data contains information about different houses in the district and my task here was to build a machine learning model to predict the House prices.
 The accuracy gotten after tuning hyper parameters was 81% , I tried as much as possible to not remove any data(rows or columns) from the data in order not to lose valuable information (maybe the model could have been better if i did).
 The evaluation metrics i used are: Mean squared error,Root mean squared log error and r2_score.
 he code file is very well detailed , so going through it and comprehending each step is easy
